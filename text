We make network connection in VBox as "Bridge" or "Virtual network"
After it we can scan ourselves with nmap to find Boot2root ip and open ports.

We found web site under this server.
So we scan 80 and 443 with dirb to find directories. It is output:

Now we have three new points: /fonts (http) and /phpmyadmin, /webmail, /forum (https).
- Fonts are not interesting for us
- phpmyadmin request creditnails. We will not brute it((
- webmail same as above.
- forum works and we can find some useful thigs inside.

On form we see theme by lmezard called "Probleme login?".
It's log and we search for some info. Here we have one string, that seems like password,
if we try it to log in forum, we will succeed. Forum login/pass - lmezard:!q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

After it we can try to Contact and now have lmezard's E-mail adress. If we try to use it to auth /webmail, we will succeed again.
/webmail login/pass - laurie@borntosec.net:!q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

In mailbox we have two messages, one of them includes creds for something called "database".
It is /phpmyadmin login/pass root/Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$

Now is time for Explotation. In phpmyadmin we can make unlimited SQL queries and it means that we could send a payload into a file.
We only should find place where we have access to write files. But we have this place. Look again at dirb output.
Trying several directories and drop php file: In one of directories var/www/forum/templates_c we have enougth rights.

Ok. Now we need reverse shell, we can generate it in base64 with help of 'https://www.revshells.com/'.
And we drop full code with PHP method base64_decode in p.php, start nc, open p.php in browser, improve our shell with python.

Now we need to explore system. We look for /home directory, there is dir LOOKATME which contains file password. NICE user login/password lmezard:G!@M6f4Eatau{sF"
